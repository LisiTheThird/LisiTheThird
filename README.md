- 👋 Hi, I’m @LisiTheThird
- 👀 I love good people, good food (mainly Thai, Indian and Polynesian), moving my body, being outdoors, and I can't get enough of stories—regardless of medium (anime, movie, books, comics, etc).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become a web developer via The Odin Project because I love creating things and solving problems, so I'm hoping this a good fit for me. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... Not too sure right now. Perhaps after I finish the Foundations Course on TOP, I'll have an answer.
- 📫 How to reach me.. might an add an email here soon. Check back later.
